## Instructions
  Because of the permissions, we can't provide the database. You need to add the susig and mcyt database to the folder.

  Run the "main.m" script in MATLAB.
  
  You can select the initialization parameters in __setting__.
 Â 
## Performance
__Note__: The result is slightly different from the report of the paper, which is mainly because the numerical differences in the process of reproduction. What's more, we find a better parameter of the classifier ID2 and slightly imporve the performance.
